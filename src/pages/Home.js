          <p>Welcome to my portfolio website!</p>
          <p>
            I have professional experience in
            React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, GraphQL, and many more. Iâ€™m seeking opportunities as a
            Software Engineer in San Diego. I'm eager to challenge myself by learning new technologies and building meaningful interfaces that'll help make many processes a lot more efficient for users.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've been working as a Software Engineer and also as an UI Engineer at MK Decision and have grown my capacity to learn new technologies, lead and support team members, and deliver features in a fast-paced environment.
